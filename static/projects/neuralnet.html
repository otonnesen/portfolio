			<h1>Deep Tree Network for Object Classification</h1>

			<p>For the final project in UVic's CSC 486B: Introduction to Deep Learning for Computer Vision, my group implemented and modified a <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02860'>state of the art machine learning model</a>.</p>

			<p>A face spoof attack is an attempt to deceive a facial recognition system by using a fake face to either impersonate a genuine user or to hide an attacker's identity. Some common such attacks include the use of makeup, masks, or printed photographs to try to bypass recognition systems. Face anti-spoofing is used as a preliminary step to filter out these spoofs before they're sent to the recognition system. The paper we reproduced used a novel Deep Tree Network to try to identify face spoofs using techniques it was not trained against.</p>

			<h3>Contributions</h3>

			<p>Our primary contribution was to apply this model to a different binary classification problem. Instead of deciding whether an image was a genuine face or a spoofed one, we modified the model to decide whether an image was human-made (like a car, a toaster, or a house) or natural (like a tree, a lake, or an animal).</p>

			<p>Our implementation also differed from the original paper's in a number of other ways:
			<ul>
				<li>We ported the model from TensorFlow2 to PyTorch</li>
				<li>Instead of hardcoding the tree depth to 3, we made it a variable hyperparameter</li>
				<li>We removed the face anti-spoofing specific binary masks used in one of the primary network modules of the original model</li>
			</ul></p>
