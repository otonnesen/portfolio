			"<p>A friend and I created this web app for the HackUVic hackathon in March 2018.",
			"We were just taking our second programming course, and went in knowing next to",
			"nothing about anything related to web development. The basic premise of the app",
			"was to make tracking money owed between our group of friends easier, by adding",
			"transactions between eachother's accounts denoting who was owed what.</p>",
			"<p>Working on this project, I learned about a variety of methods, protocols and technologies:</p>",
			"<ul>",
			"<li>Creating and consuming HTTP APIs</li>",
			"<li>Sanitizing user input</li>",
			"<li>Implementing a database</li>",
			"<li>Managing user authentication</li>",
			"<li>Tracking state with cookies</li>",
			"</ul>",
			"<h3>Creating and consuming HTTP APIs</h3>",
			"<p>We used Flask, a Python library, to make our HTTP server",
			"and made routes to create, read, and update transactions with",
			"GET and POST methods, as well as to create and  log in to user",
			"accounts.</p>",
			"<p>Our client was written in pure JavaScript and communicated directly",
			"with our Python server. Our JavaScript handled things like checking",
			"that usernames were available and contained only allowed characters",
			"and checking the validity of logins.</p>",
			"<h3>Sanitizing user input</h3>",
			"<p>We used the built in templating system that came with Flask --",
			"Jinja2 -- to render our HTML. After figuring out how templates",
			"worked, this did everything we needed as far as input sanitation",
			"went.</p>",
			"<h3>Implementing a database</h3>",
			"<p>We used PostgreSQL to store our data (which, looking back, was",
			"way overkill). I had learned a bit of SQL in a course the semester",
			"before, so I had a pretty good idea of what I wanted to do once I",
			"had the database server running, but getting it running was quite",
			"the project. I eventually got it set up and connected to our Python",
			"server, however, and wrote all of our transaction and login logic.",
			"set up as stored procedures.</p>",
			"<h3>Managing user authentication</h3>",
			"<p>I read an OWASP cheatsheet to learn how to properly store passwords",
			"for our user accounts. We used Postgres' built in crypt function and",
			"generated a salt with its implementation of the blowfish cipher.",
			"Otherwise, we simply sent the password to see if its hash matched",
			"the one stored in the database.</p>",
			"<h3>Tracking state with cookies</h3>",
			"<p>When a user logs in, we store their username in a cookie to later",
			"send to the database whenever they want to view their transactions.",
			"We used Flask's built in session manager to achieve this.</p>",
			"<p>Although the end product is not very impressive visually or",
			"functionally, this project was one of the most valuable learning",
			"experiences I had in my first year at UVic. I often find myself",
			"coming back for reference and to steal code from this project.</p>"

			"<p><a href='https://play.battlesnake.io'>Battlesnake</a> is a",
			"yearly programming competition held in Victoria, BC wherein teams",
			"must write a web server capable of playing a variation of the",
			"classic Snake game.</p",
			"<p>I've competed in this event twice, in 2018 and in 2019. My first",
			"time competing, myself and two friends entered into the beginner",
			"division. We spent the entire day trying to implement a single graph",
			"algorithm and eventually entered as 'Bogo Snake' inspired by its",
			"seemingly random and definitely suboptimal move choices, similar",
			"to the bogo sort algorithm. We didn't place very well that year,",
			"but we had enough fun to come back the next year, this time each",
			"writing our own snakes.</p>",
			"<p>The main premise of my snake this year was to take each possible",
			"move, run through a set of filters to remove any that would cause me",
			"to immediately die, and then run each remaining move through a set",
			"of heuristics that leave them (hopefully) in order from best to worst.",
			"I felt confident and entered this snake into the intermediate bracket.",
			"My snake worked surprisingly well when pitted against two or three",
			"other snakes during testing, but I later found out that I had tweaked",
			"it to be too greedy to effectively compete against the full board of",
			"eight, and again I was knocked out early, but this time at least with",
			"a snake I was much more proud of.</p>",
			"<p>Overall, battlesnake is always a fun way to hang out with friends and",
			"make new ones. Even more, it's a nice break from the C and Assembly code",
			"I have to write for my classes, and lets me try out some of the new",
			"algorithms and techniques I learn throughout the year in a bit less",
			"contrived of a setting.</p>"
